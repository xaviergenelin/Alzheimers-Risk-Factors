# Alzheimers-Risk-Factors

## Purpose 
This project explores MRI scan data on demented and non-demented individuals. The goal of the project is to identify a set of risk factors associated with those identified with Alzheimer-onset dementia. This will examine 5 different classification models, a Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-NN Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Logistic Regression. All models will be done using PySpark and PCA as a step in building a pipeline to select features. 

## Dependencies
* pyspark
* scipy
* sklearn
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn

## Dataset Description 
The data utilized was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers?datasetId=1980&language=R)'s repository of datasets.

## Machine Learning Techniques
There will be 5 different models that are utilized:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. K-NN Classifier
4. XGBoost Classifier
5. Logistic Regression
